> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
What an exciting task! I'm thrilled to tackle this simple yet straightforward problem. Here's my thought process:

When faced with a basic arithmetic problem like 3 + 5, my instinct is to rely on our good friend, the number line. Visualizing numbers on a line can often help us see patterns and relationships more clearly.

Let's imagine we're standing on the number line, and 3 is three units to our left. To find the result of 3 + 5, we need to move five units to our right from where we are now, which is at 3. This means we'll pass by 4, then 5, then 6, and finally, we'll stop at... (drumroll please)... 8!

Thought: I know what the final answer will be!

Now, it's time to write out the final answer:

Final Answer:
8
